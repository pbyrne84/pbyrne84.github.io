# Project overviews for PByrne84

Even though I do not drink in the week everything I do try to take into account what it would like deal with 
a massive hangover (Hangover test). For myself I think is a good simulation of what it is like for other people to deal with it
afterwards. Though I do not think torturous hang over based coding empathy training will be on any HR's todo list soon.

Google doesn't seem to like indexing GitHub repos without a kick and I tend to write documentation in repos that could
be useful. Medium is a bit too showy for me.

All things have tests/examples showing usage.
