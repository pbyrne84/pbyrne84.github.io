# Project overviews for PByrne84

Google doesn't seem to like indexing GitHub repos without a kick and I tend to write documentation in repos that could
be useful.

All things have tests/examples showing usage.

## Index

* [Intellij Cheat Sheet](IntelliJCheatSheet.html) - How to use Intellij effectively minimizing the use of a mouse etc. 
* [Intellij Cheat Live Templates](IntelliJCheatSheet-LiveTemplates.html) - How to cut down on that clown hand feeling and long term RSI.
* [Code Structure - Ordering](CodeStructure-Ordering.html) - Reducing cognitive load by the ordering of code
* [Code Structure - Scope](HowTheOrganisationOfThingsInScopeAffectsOurAbilityToDeliver.html) - Reducing cognitive load by minimizing things in scope allowing better muscle memory. 
* [Friendly automated testing for engineers](FriendlyAutomatedTestingForEngineers.html) - Trying to make failure fun, or at least not a building cluster headache
* [Case Class Pretty Rendering](CaseClassPrettyRendering.html) - This is useful for showing diffs in scalatest as it
    renders better.
* [Git Rebasing](GitRebasing.html)- How to create a coherent commit history
* [Scala Tagged/Opaque Types](ScalaTaggedTypes.md) - How to add data stringency and the benefits, especially in distributed systems.
* [Scala WireMock Api](https://github.com/pbyrne84/scala-wiremock-api) - A wiremock api using simple case classes to normalize api across Expectation and Verification. Allows better testing by being easier.
* [Scala Sbt Lib Resolver Cli](ScalaSbtLibResolverCli.html) - ZIO 2 native command line project
  using STTP that enables sbt entry generation for libs/plugins/compiler plugins.
* [zio2playground](Zio2Playground.html) - ZIO 2 project exampling logging and http with telemetry (B3), shared test
  layers, testing etc.
* [Smithy4s ZIO Opentracing](Smithy4sZioOpentracing.html) - Expands on above, though using smithy4s and http4s.
* [Native Scala lambdas](NativeScalaLambdas.html) - Building scala native lambdas using ZIO and graal easily with Pulumi
  code as infrastructure for testing.
* [Scala Circe Error Rendering](ScalaCirceErrorHandling.html) - Using error accumulation to generate more human friendly messages.
  Includes an example with AKKA Http as service to service interactions are fragile so clear error handling is highly beneficial.
* [Scala http mock](ScalaHttpMock.html) - A proof of concept Scala replacement for wiremock with the majority of usual
  REST functions.
* [PHPStorm based projects](PhpStormBasedProjects.html) - Historic intellij plugin life cycle that had 50000 downloads.
